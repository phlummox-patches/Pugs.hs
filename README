This module provides a Haskell interface to embedded Perl 5 interpreter.

Documentation and functionality is scarce at the moment; see test.hs for
some basic usage examples.

Currently supported features are:
    * Function calls
    * Method calls
    * Module imports
    * Callbacks

Eventually the entirety of Pugs.Embed.Perl5 and Pugs.Run.Perl5 will be
carried into this module.
